This is a repository for my personal site [henkkalaukka.fi)(https://henkkalaukka.fi). 

It is built on Hugo with some heavy modifications to add a book tracking feature as well as incorporate some poems that I've written.

It also deploys automatically to a Hetzner webhosting server.

Other than that it's just your basic static website setup.
